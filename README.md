This repo is made for a refactor and branding of the Paper Through Time web site. The goals of this 

- Leave the core content unchanged.
- Improve the accessibility of the site such that it meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (as of May 2022).
- Augment the interface of the site to include [University of Iowa branding standards](https://brand.uiowa.edu).
